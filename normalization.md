# Normalization

#### Definition: Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between them.

## Normalization Forms:

- `First Normal Form (1NF)`: Ensure each column contains atomic values, and each record is unique.

- `Second Normal Form (2NF)`: Achieve 1NF and ensure all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

- `Third Normal Form (3NF):` Achieve 2NF and ensure all attributes are functionally dependent only on the primary key.

## How to Normalize:

- Identify Functional Dependencies: Determine which attributes are dependent on others.
- Decompose Tables: Break tables into smaller tables to remove redundancy.
- Define Relationships: Use foreign keys to maintain relationships between decomposed tables

## Our schema

### User

- All attributes depend only on user_id.

- role is not derived from any other attribute.

### Property

- All attributes depend on property_id.

- host_id is a foreign key, but not a transitive dependency.

### Booking

- property_id and user_id are foreign keys, not derived from each other.

- All other attributes (start_date, total_price, etc.) depend only on booking_id.

### Payment

- All attributes depend on payment_id.

- amount, payment_method are not derivable from other attributes.

### Review

- Attributes like rating, comment depend only on review_id.

- Even though it references a property and user, no transitive dependency exists.

### Message

- All attributes depend on message_id.

- Sender and recipient are foreign keys, and message_body depends only on message_id.

### Summary:

- Atomic fields.

- No partial dependencies.

- No transitive dependencies.

- Proper use of foreign keys without violating normalization.
